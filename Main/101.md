# Build-in package manager

The I programming language should include an built-in package manager. It should be names something like `I-pack`.

## Proposed features

Features of this package manager should include, but not be limited to:

- Ease of use
- Easy install with one command, like `ipack install ...`
- Easy packaging with one command, like `ipack build ...`
- Easy distribution with one command, like `ipack upload ...`
- Centralized package platform, like [PyPi](https://pypi.org/)
