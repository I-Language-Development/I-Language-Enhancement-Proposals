!!! danger "Breaking change"
    This is a breaking change.

## Proposed changes

Make semicolons necessary. This means that

```py

something()

```

becomes

```py

something();

```

This does not include the REPL version tho, so

```py

>>> something()
Output

```

stays that way.


This can be done simply inside of the pest grammar.
