# Make semicolons necessary

!!! danger "Breaking change"
    This is a breaking change.

This design update makes semicolons necessary for all files. This does not includes the REPL version.
Linked pull request(s): [`#85`](https://github.com/I-Language-Development/I-language-rust/issues/85).

## Proposed changes

Make semicolons necessary. This means that

```python title="Before"

print("Hello World!")

```

becomes

```python title="After"

print("Hello World!");

```

This does not include the REPL version tho, so

```python title="REPL"

>>> print("Hello World!")
Hello World!

```

stays that way.

This can be done simply inside of the pest grammar.
