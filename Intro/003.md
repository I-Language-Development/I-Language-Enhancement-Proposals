# What is this language not?

This file contains information about the things we **do not** want to do with our language/things it isn't built for.

    [What is this language?](./002.md)

## Goals not to archive

Things we don't want are:

- Complicated syntax
- Backwards compatibility for years (like C or C++)
- Super fast execution times (If the output is better, compiling might be slower)
- Utils/Editor plugins for everything (We want them, but won't focus on it. If you have made one, contact us via [email](mailto:elbe.dev.plaq@gmail.com) or [our discord server](https://discord.gg/JVyyDukQqV) (preferred))
