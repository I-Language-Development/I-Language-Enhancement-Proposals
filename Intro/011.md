# Git specific conventions

## `.gitignore`

!!! info
    The `.gitignore` file is a file that contains files not to show as available for staging/committing.

!!! note
    There is a version designed for the github choose gitignore feature. You can find it [here](https://github.com/I-Language-Development/gitignore).

The `.gitignore` file for I projects should look something like this/exactly like this:

```gitignore

# See https://i-language-rust.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ILEPs/Intro/011/#.gitignore

# Build output
build/

# Autodoc output
output/

```

## Git submodules

The I programming language can import git submodules and use them as any ordinary other module.
