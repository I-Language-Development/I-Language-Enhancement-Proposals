**I** **L**anguage **E**nhancement **P**roposals (ILEPs) are requests for change and guides for editors. This could be a request, for a new feature (new features should always be requested as an ILEP, when they are big enough).

## Namespaces

- `000` - `099` Internal things
- `100` - `299` Module changes
- `300` - `999` Everything else

!!! note
The numbering scheme might change as the language grows.
