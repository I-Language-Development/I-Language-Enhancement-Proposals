# Styleguide

This file contains the official style guide for the I-programming language.

## I-Language

### File/Module Docstrings

The file should contain a docstring at the top, formatted like this:

``` c title="Example"

/*
{SHORT DESCRIPTION}
{VERSION}

[{AUTHOR}]
{LICENSE TEXT}
*/

```

This is just a recommendation and used in all I-language files. There should be one space below them before the next [section](#sections).

### Import statements

The import statements should be in the simplest form:

``` py title="Example"

import MODULE;

```

or

``` py title="Example"

import MODULE from PACKAGE;

```

Custom namespaces are allowed but should be used rarely.

### Sections

Sections can be separated by following comments with two empty lines above, and one below them.

``` c title="Example"

//////////
// NAME //
//////////

```

### Variables

Variables should be separated from constants, above them. They should be lowercase, with underscores as separators.

``` js title="Example"

var NAME = VALUE;

```

or

``` js title="Example"

type NAME = VALUE;

```

### Constants

Constants should be in uppercase letters.

``` js title="Example"

const NAME = VALUE;

```

or

``` js title="Example"

const type NAME = VALUE;

```
