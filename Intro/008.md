# Styleguide
This file contains the official style guide for the I-programming language.

## I-Language
### File/Module Docstrings
The file should contain a docstring at the top, formatted like this:
```
/*
{SHORT DESCRIPTION}
{VERSION}

[{AUTHOR}]
{LICENSE TEXT}
*/
```
This is just a recommendation and used in all I-language files. There should be one space below them before the next [section](#sections).

### Import statements
The import statements should be in the simplest form:
```
import MODULE
```
or
```
import MODULE from PACKAGE
```
Custom namespaces are allowed but should be used rarely.

### Sections
Sections can be separated by following comments with two empty lines above, and one below them.
```
//////////
// NAME //
//////////
```

### Variables
Variables should be separated from constants, above them. They should be lowercase, with underscores as separators.
```
var NAME = VALUE
```
or
```
type NAME = VALUE
```

### Constants
Constants should be in uppercase letters.

## Python

## Naming
Files: lowercase with underscores, underscore at the beginning if the name already exists

Folders: lowercase with underscores

Variables: lowercase with underscores

Constants: uppercase with underscores

Functions: lowercase with underscores

Classes: pascal case without underscores
