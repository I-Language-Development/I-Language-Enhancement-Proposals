# Decisions

This file contains all the decisions made by the core team for the whole project. They are just recommendations.

## Editor / IDE

The recommended editor is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) or [Neovim](https://neovim.org).

## Version control system

The recommended version control system is [Git](https://git-scm.org) on [GitHub](https://github.com). Pre-commit is highly recommended. There will be **no** forks on GitLab, Bitbucket or any other version control system.

### Commit format

Commits should be formatted in the [conventional commit format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) starting with `v1.0.0-alpha4`.

## Documentation

The recommended documentation system is [mkdocs](https://mkdocs.org) with the [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material) theme, deploying to [readthedocs](https://readthedocs.com).

## Release versioning

The versioning scheme is [Semantic Versioning 2.0](https://semver.org) and the changelog scheme is [Keep a changelog 1.1](https://keepachangelog.com).

## Linter

The recommended linter is [megalinter](https://megalinter.io/latest/) (CI), in combination with [clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy). This linter will be executed automatically when using pre-commit. All linters are included in megalinter.

## Code formatter

The recommended code formatters are [fmt](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/) and [prettier](https://prettier.io/), as well as [black](https://github.com/psf/black) for python code.

## Todo comments

The recommended Todo comments scheme is following:

```text

TODO ({RESPONSIBLE EDITOR}): {SHORT DESCRIPTION} [(#{ISSUE/PR-NUMBER})]

```
